**`Software Engineer`**

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a primary focus on .NET! Being a man of few words, I have a HUGE passion for coding and I am in the business of infinite growth. Coding is a huge part of who I am, feel free to stop by and look around. I would like to think my projects are innovative and FUN! :)
